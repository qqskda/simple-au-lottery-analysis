Idea: 

* Statistics given by the lottery website implies "Each number has the same chances for being drawn (independently), hence the repetitions per number are roughly the same in the long term perspective."

* However, do the statistics have the result because of the null hypothesis? Or are there correlations among numbers while "reps per each number are roughly the same in overall" ?
